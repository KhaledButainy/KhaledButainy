# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Khaled!

I am an AI/ML engineer by training, and I enjoy learning about new things everyday!

## What I am currently doing:
- Expanding my AI knowledge and skills - learning more about Agentic systems, fine-tuning, evaluation, and safety.
- I love reading - topics in technology, behavioural economics, product management, and finance are within my interests.
- Working on cloud certificates and exploring my next career move!
